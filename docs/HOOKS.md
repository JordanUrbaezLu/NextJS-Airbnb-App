No, creating your own specific hook does not necessarily require the use of useEffect. The useEffect hook is a general-purpose hook used for handling side effects in components, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, or interacting with the browser's DOM. However, not all custom hooks need to deal with side effects.

Custom hooks are primarily used for encapsulating and reusing specific sets of logic within functional components. They can be composed of any combination of existing hooks and other JavaScript functions or variables. The goal of a custom hook is to abstract away repetitive or complex logic and provide a simple interface for consuming that logic in multiple components.
